One ADJ Wednesday afternoon, Bob decides to attend an exciting PETCS meeting! Bob happily walks into the ADJ classroom choosing to VERBS by their favourite computer. The execs warmly greet all attending members and announce the lesson they are teaching: NOUN! Everyone is puzzled, but agree to VERBP to the lesson. Halfway through the lesson, the principal VERBS into the room. He shouts at everyone to leave the premise as there is a ADJ NOUN  happening at the school soon Bob being the smart student they are, chooses to VERBS out of the NOUN to escape the potential harm. With the PETCS meeting coming to an abrupt end Bob decides to go home and ADVERB work on their ADJ homework.
