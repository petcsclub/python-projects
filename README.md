# How to Use
Preface: everything here will be done on repl.it. You are welcome to do things locally if you'd like too! 

1. Connect GitHub to replit account
	1. Go to https://repl.it/~
	2. You should see an option to connect your GitHub to your repl.it account, click it and follow the instructions
2. Click [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/petcsclub/python-projects)](https://repl.it/github/petcsclub/python-projects) This will create a repl in your own personal folder, not on the PETCS folder.
3. Create a new branch
	1. Click the version control menu on the left sidebar (second one down).
	2. You will see a text field that says: "branch: master". Beside that field, you will see a plus sign. Click it to create a new branch, and name it depending on what you're creating (e.g., name the branch battleship if you're making the game battleship)
4. Setup project
	1. If you are just making a simple game with only one variant, you probably only need one file. In that case, just make a file in the root of the repl (e.g., `battleship.py`)
	2. If you are making multiple variants of the game, you should make a folder. Create a new folder in the root of the repl with the appropriate name (e.g., battleship). Then in that folder, make the appropriate files depending on the variants (e.g., `battleship-single-player.py`, `battleship-multi-player.py`)
5. Start coding!
	1. To run the file, run the following command in the terminal: `python directory/filename.py`. Examples: `python battleship.py` (for the first example with only 1 file), `python battleship/battleship-single-player.py` (for the second example with multiple files)
	2. Commits! Make a commit every time you make some sort of small change to your code. That way, it is easier to track your progress over time and make fixes/revert changes if things go wrong (in the chance that they do). The rule of thumb is "commit early, commit often", at least a couple times every hour.  Worry more about making too few commits than too many.
	3. Commit messages: actually make them meaningful and write about what changes you made. More specific = better, but don't go toooo specific.
	4. How to make commits? Again, go to the version control. In the what did you change? text box, write the commit message. Then click the button "commit and push". That's one commit!
	5. Note: if you need to switch between branches, commit all your changes before doing so. Otherwise, all your changes will be lost! :( 
6. Pull requests
	1. If you think you're done the project, make sure everything is commented and there aren't any visible/obvious errors. Then go to the [website of the repo](https://github.com/petcsclub/python-projects) and create a pull request for your specific branch. Read more here on how to [create one](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr). 
	2. We'll have a couple people review your code, check it for bugs/flaws, and have you fix up a couple things if you need to. Then we'll merge the pull request. Congrats!
